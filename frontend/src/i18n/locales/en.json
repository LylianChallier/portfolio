    "description": "MSc student at CentraleSupelec, specialized in mathematics, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This year, I was selected for the Digital Tech Year, an innovation program that allows me to develop strong skills in agile prototyping through concrete projects for Renault Group, the French National Library and Matmut.",
    "subdescription": "Having these skills is essential to move from theory to practice. I can thus contribute at several stages of a project: mathematical theory, model architecture, optimization algorithms, results interpretation as well as deployment."
